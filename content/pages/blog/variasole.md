  The VARIASOLE is a mass-customised, orthotic insole designed to alleviate
  plantar pressure for those suffering from ulceration or infection, especially
  in a diabetic context.

The VARIASOLE uses a customised, variable density structure to redistribute pressure evenly across the sole. This improves blood flow and can be used to treat infection, ulceration and neuropathy, particularly for those living with diabetes.

There are 4 steps for a patient to have their own VARIASOLE:

1\. 3D Scanning: To ensure a perfect fit, a patient’s feet are 3D scanned using a LiDAR Scanner. This also allows sores and ulcers to be accommodated by the insole.

2\. Pressure Mapping: A snapshot of the pressures across a patients gait cycle are recorded using a TekScan Pressure Array.

3\. VARIASOLE CAD Tool: Our CAD Tool uses a pressure-reduction algorithm that analyses the pressure mapping and calculates how to distribute pressure evenly across the patients sole. It then generates a variable density lattice structure within the insole volume defined by the 3D scan to produce a digital VARIASOLE model.

4\. 3D Printing: The resulting model is then 3D-printed using a soft TPU material, resulting in a custom shoe insole with Shore A hardness ranging from 28 to 44. This process leverages automation to significantly reduce the labour cost of producing custom orthotic insoles.

The VARIASOLE differentiates itself from existing orthotic insoles as it provides the patient with the pressure reduction of a bespoke, hand-crafted insole at a fraction of the cost. A pair of these custom insoles can be made for $20-40 NZD as there is minimal labour cost involved due to the automated VARIASOLE CAD tool and 3D-printing. This is significantly cheaper than hand-crafted orthotic insoles, which can cost upwards of $600 NZD. When tested against off-the-shelf insoles in a similar price range, the VARIASOLE performs significantly better. I observed a 70.1% improvement in pressure reduction when comparing the VARIASOLE to a similarly priced ‘memory-foam’ insole. Furthermore, the VARIASOLE recorded plantar pressure over an area 8.5% greater than that of the other insole, which suggests it is more effective at redistributing pressure. Therefore, it is clear the VARIASOLE is an effective and affordable treatment for diabetic foot diseases.

This project was awarded a ‘Part-IV Project Award’ presented by the Mechanical Engineering Group of New Zealand. In 2022 Furthermore, this project contributed to the achievement of the ‘John McLaren Youth Award’ presented by Diabetes New Zealand to one of the team members in 2023.
